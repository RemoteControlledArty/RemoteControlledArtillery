/*
	TO DO / DONE LIST
*/


TO DO - BUGFIXES:

-if does not camera points in sky (cannot find range), show red warning "raise camera", (accuracy will be way off and submunitions wont deploy otherwise )
-make MLRS/MRL rockets appear in launcher (if possible)

-REMOVE CBA Setting for EL Diff, as this could f up the formula
-fix EL Diff mybe not getting calculated when being negative

-low angle ETA is broke, and changes with turret EL

-does it still need include check for ace hpp?


DONE - BUGFIXES:

-UI fixed on normal UI scale
-lights off, can simply be done by user in the UAV terminal
-Olive Backpack picture background fix
-armor value fixes
-changed to 9.8066 Gravity
-engine turnoff delay exceptions now per cfg value

-fixed distance calculation
-fixed time of flight calculation


TO DO - FEATURES:

-attemt to create O mine pattern
-magazine shell count attributes code? (Who wrote this, what is meant by it?)
-only disable driver = 4, for modularity

-add datalink designator?
-update removemagazine list
-test weapon canLock=2;

-renaming remaining assets for clarity
-attemt slight forward offset for airburst, so it has better low angle airburst, but not large high angle impact difference
-display peak ASL
-markers being "gps" artillery targets lockable on panel, for guided shells

-add low trajectory TOP DOWN formula & display for guided (low firing solution + ? meter height)
-get missle feed panel to connect to missle
-fix laser scanner reliability
-datalink target speed


next:
-hide seats for RC IC
-attemt to add commander seat to RC IC
-assault pack for AR-3&4	//would add a bit much backpacks
-add new assets to cfg patches list
-add 82mm multi quited
-fix radar turrets viewoptics maxhorrotspeed
-find out why 227mm HEAB has no recoil
-edit 120mm cannon charges
-normal spread for mines for now
-reload time etc edits without charges
-decrease sensor angles

-aiAmmoUsageFlags https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/CfgAmmo_Config_Reference#aiAmmoUsageFlags
-fix Static AT laser engaging
-enable Static AT NLOS


DONE - FEATURES:

-added 82mm, 155mm, 227mm HE Airburst
-added 82mm, 155mm Laser Guided 1.8m Delayed Fuse (for use against small bunkers/ hangars/ ammo storage halls) but only available per attributes edit for balancing reasons
-improved spead of cluster and mines
-buffed 82mm and 155mm smoke
-added 82mm AP and AT mines
-40 magazines for all shells

-required low&high turret elevation display + ETA
-if turret azimuth matches target azimuth, turn green
-if charge is correct for target distance, turn green
-if azimuth correct, turret elevation correct "ready to fire"
-warning if camera is pointed not at sky

-explain target marker referencing to current subscribers

(new)

-ammunition naming improvements
-added Datalink panel
-added Datalink laser position finder
-added Datalink selected target position finder
-added AR-3 & 4
-added 604mm ATACMS
-added RC Infantry Carrier
-renamed assets for clarity
-155mm dispersion fixed
-more but finer 155mm charges, to have more angle variety, and enough airburst even with low angle solution
-added optional 67km datalink range (max firing range)
-added peak ASL calculation
-shortend map marker search time (as its only running during active remote control, and improves quality of life)
-fixed all sensor configs
-added 82mm/155mm/227mm Laser/IR/Vis Guided (Can in manual fire lock laser and vehicles on Datalink panel. Or in artillery computer fire find laser spots, and hot (per IR) or cold (per Visual) vehicles.)
-reworked 82mm/155mm/227mm Laser/IR/Vis Guided, to be more accurate and Multi Target
-reworked Static AT & ATGM, changed ammo from 4 HEAT & 2 HE to new 4 MT (MultiTarget) rounds, Static AT now has more locking options and also SACLOS


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/lockCameraTo  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/enableDirectionStabilization  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/camSetTarget
-azimuth camera lock (marker, laser, selected, off), as uneven surfaces make keeping azimuth aligned problematic
-or atleast hotkey to swing to azimuth *cannot lock directly to direction of target to az changing with uneven ground
-maybe turret elevation lock?


DONE - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-lower FOV for driving now available
-option for very slightly shorter map marker search
-if vehicle speed = 0 then turn off engine true

-map now available for ALL assets :D


IDEAS - FUTURE:

-vanilla asset overwrite for gamemodes without zeus etc
-switch driver and commander of recon radar
-counterbattery radar
-3R MRSI display
-3R automated MRSI
-parachute cam round for spotting (or simply additional rhs comp mod for hunt ir)















OLD (only kept copy as history):

TO DO - BUGFIXES:

-figure out why MRL and sometimes Howitzer shoots left/right if not aligned...


DONE - BUGFIXES:

-remove human crew hpp and hpp include in config
-hasdriver=-1 removed from all vics
-added lockdriver/commander to likely all vics
-all vehicles now steerable again
-target range cut of when 5 digits
-target cycle keybinds (4 is MRS/MLRS charge) change to 3 and 5

-fix RC_ATGM privated
-fix loop when joining server


TO DO - FEATURES:

-HE airburst, 82mm, 120mm, 155mm, 227mm

-magazine shell count attributes code? (Who wrote this, what is meant by it?)
-only disable driver = 4, for modularity

-explain target marker referencing to current subscribers


DONE - FEATURES:

-RCdisableseats= 1 for loacking commander seat  2 for locking driver and commander seat
-isRCarty=1;  as mod friendly check if display should appear
-howitzer can drive in gunner seat
-added target marker referencing, calculation and display

-added 230mm laser guided and AT guided rockets (unclear if they work)

-added 


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-light off! esp Recon Nyx

-if vehicle speed = 0 then turn off engine true
-cannot open map with: mortar, MRL, static AA / AT / ATGM, laser des

-if turret azimuth matches target azimuth, turn green
-if charge is correct for target distance, turn green

-improve turret elevation formula, that accounts for elevation difference better


DONE - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-create basic turret elevation formula https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fsya2kyque?lang=de
