/*
	TO DO / DONE LIST
*/


TO DO - BUGFIXES:

-RC Recon RADAR activated by default to make it actually usefull (works when deleting commander and activating it manual, or human ai is in there, not with uav ai even with https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/setVehicleRadar)
-does it still need include check for ace hpp?
-if arty is destroyed, ui stays...?
-turn off motor should ONLY be activated for this mods assets per config value, as for example vanilla UGV is now broken!
-crl+h cuts connection and destroys UV?
-ar2 problems on server, is it due to some of the scripts, or a server issue?
-turret is locked unable to adjust up/down, when scope of player is adjustable...
-HEAB with aimabovetarget explodes too early with negative gun elevation, or low charge direct fire... *maybe swap to normal HE magazines per script when turret has negative elevation


TO DO - FEATURES:

documentation:
-update removemagazine list
-add new assets to cfg patches list
-add incomingMissileDetectionSystem = 16;

arty:
-report arty map markers to datalink, to lock for gps guidance, maybe if "gps" is written in the marker name? RC_O_InvisibleDatalinkTarget works
-add datalink & laser firing solution display
-add low trajectory TOP DOWN formula & display for when multiguided is used (low firing solution + 200meter height)
-datalink selected target speed display near firing solution, to decide if it makes sence to fire

-recon radar mortar carrier composition
-double check LaserDatalink code

-using multiguided without selecting target and looking at terrain, can cause automatic targeting of friendly UV's?
-why the slight overshoot habit of the calculator? its about 1 to 2 MIL too high for low trajectory, maybe due to extra height of barrel vs ground? thats why aimabove/2 is needed rn
-how to get position of muzzle? 	gunBeg="Usti hlavne";	gunEnd="Konec hlavne";	https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/220406-universal-way-to-get-any-turrets-direction/
_uav = (getConnectedUAV player);
//_uav selectionPosition ["Konec hlavne", "Memory", "FirstPoint"];
//_uav selectionPosition ["Usti hlavne", "Memory", "FirstPoint"];
//_uav selectionPosition ["Konec hlavne", "Memory", "AveragePoint"];
//_uav selectionPosition ["Konec hlavne", "Memory", "BoundingBox"];


-remove non airburst HE after trajectory testing

*NOTE to self, marker moving with ctrl+lmb is extremly practical for correcting fire and aiming multiple smokes!
*NOTE to self, AT mines should be deployed about 20m after a unifying crossroad, not on it, due to inaccuracy
*NOTE to self, wood+too few sandbag roof of usual MG/GMG bunkers do luckly not protect against 155mm airburst

general:
-change uav connection script location
-maybe decrease sensor angles
-fix Static AT laser engaging (how!?)

RC IC:
-hide seats for RC IC
-attemt to add commander seat to RC IC
-RC IC if hull and engine is red then remove AI until repaired, so it doesnt keep getting engaged
-fix driver view
-fix or remove datalink panel
-weaker steering

RC Respawn Truck (not priority, can be post update):
-add more versions
-edit hitpoints
-lock seats
-add respawn script

NLOS FSV:
-impact identicator is off
-widen FOV
-remove gunner&commander
-find a way to lock seats depending on current seat

AR-short:
-script for grain based on distance, and making sure effect is reset when leaving uav 


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-only disable driver = 4, for modularity
-turret azimuth lock hotkey, for when changing EL on uneven ground throws it off

-markers showing up on datalink panel, to be lockable for gps guidance?
-get missle feed panel to connect to missle

-magazine shell count attributes code? (Who wrote this, what is meant by it?)
-aiAmmoUsageFlags https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/CfgAmmo_Config_Reference#aiAmmoUsageFlags


IDEAS - FAR FUTURE:

-RC Marid with upgraded engines 7.62x51 and smoke GL

-direct fire firing solution (camera viewpoint)
-yellow 10m radius for Azimuth&GunEL, for fire adjustments
-maybe add max spread display / hit propability display (HEAB = 30m radius, inaccuracy at marked distance = ? radius, = ? hit probability)

-video partially at night for rocket and explosion effects

-make MLRS/MRL rockets appear in launcher (if possible)
-https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/lockCameraTo  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/enableDirectionStabilization  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/camSetTarget
-azimuth camera lock (marker, laser, selected, off), as uneven surfaces make keeping azimuth aligned problematic
-or atleast hotkey to swing to azimuth *cannot lock directly to direction of target to az changing with uneven ground
-vanilla asset overwrite for gamemodes without zeus etc *maybe by second pbo and config, class RC_Howitzer; class vanilla_Howitzer: vanilla_Howitzer  but likely doesnt work
-switch driver and commander of recon radar
-3R MRSI display
-3R automated MRSI
-parachute cam round for spotting (or simply additional rhs comp mod for hunt ir, maybe with datalink/laser)

-turret elevationmode=3 (switchable between manual and automatic), changing script to low trajectory, and point of aim height instead ground height
-more detailed 120mm damage difference

-getting misslecam panel to work with multiguided
-counterbattery radar, reporting targets to datalink network, with cba settings on detection speed and range
-RC respawn truck script
-RC RHS (HIMARS, M109 etc) to bring back aweness post update


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-if does not camera points in sky (cannot find range), show red warning "raise camera", (accuracy will be way off and submunitions wont deploy otherwise)
-fix radar turrets viewoptics maxhorrotspeed
-fixed distance calculation
-fixed time of flight calculation


DONE - FEATURES:

-added 82mm, 120mm, 155mm, 227mm HE Airburst
-added 82mm, 120mm, 155mm Laser Guided 1.8m Delayed Fuse (for use against small bunkers/ hangars/ ammo storage halls) but only available per attributes edit for balancing reasons
-improved spread of cluster and mines
-buffed smoke of 82mm, 120mm, 155mm
-added 82mm AP and AT mines
-40 magazines for all shells
-required low&high turret elevation display + ETA
-if turret azimuth matches target azimuth, turn green
-if charge is correct for target distance, turn green
-if azimuth correct, turret elevation correct "ready to fire"
-warning if camera is pointed not at sky
-explain target marker referencing to current subscribers

(new)
-ammunition naming improvements
-added Datalink panel
-added Datalink laser position finder
-added Datalink selected target position finder
-added AR-3 & 4
-added 604mm ATACMS
-added RC Infantry Carrier
-renamed assets for clarity
-155mm dispersion fixed
-more but finer 155mm charges, to have more angle variety, and enough airburst even with low angle solution
-added optional 67km datalink range (max firing range)
-added peak ASL calculation formula
-shortend map marker search time (as its only running during active remote control, and improves quality of life)
-fixed all sensor configs
-added 82mm/120/155mm/227mm MultiGuided (Can in manual fire lock laser and vehicles on Datalink panel. Or in artillery computer fire find laser spots, and hot (per IR) or cold (per Visual) vehicles.)
-reworked 82mm/120/155mm/227mm MultiGuided, to be more accurate and be Multi Target
-reworked Static AT & ATGM, changed ammo from 4 HEAT & 2 HE to new 4 MT (MultiTarget) rounds, Static AT now has more locking options and also SACLOS
-reworked 120mm charges
-multi guided successfully tested to include gps guidance, but so far only when using artillery computer
-artillery weapon edits in steps, so different versions can be chosen V1 until V4
-split shown ELDiff, and ElDiff for used calculation, to not cause errors
-enabled NLOS for locking ATGM
-tweaked AT mine spread
-reworked 120mm, 155mm, 227mm Airburst, to truly explode before impact (instead of being reset 20meters after impact)
-decided to not use reworked Airburst for 82mm as it can cause fatal explosion when camera is obstructed and not able to point in sky
-minor change to howitzer max gun elevation for it be able to shoot closer during compound defense
-added RC RespawnTruck & correct driver camera screen with filter
-reworked Laser Guided 2m Delayed Fuse
-added nightvision to RC RespawnTruck driver camera
-done lots of testing and decided on MT MultiGuided visual model
-added LaserDatalink so that handheld LaserDesignators enable reliable use with Artillery, and decreases reliance of UAV's with Datalink
-testing showed that locking MultiGuided to laser target, firing manual, deactivating laser, has 3 practical results:
	if nothing else is close it switches to gps guidance,
	or if enemy vehicles are close it locks on them,
	which is extremly usefull if the ForwardObserver is suppressed and cannot maintain the lase,
	if the laser is reactivated, it relocks if it is close enough to the original point
-improved 227mm explosion effect
-added N/LOS FSV
-fixed Airburst
-added AR1/AR3 backpacks
-improved mine spread


DONE - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-lower FOV for better driving now available
-option for shorter map marker search
-if vehicle speed = 0 then engine is turned off
-map now available for all assets!
-significant mod folder and hpp restructure
