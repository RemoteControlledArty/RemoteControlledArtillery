/*
	TO DO / DONE LIST
*/


TO DO - BUGFIXES:

-if does not camera points in sky (cannot find range), show red warning "raise camera", (accuracy will be way off and submunitions wont deploy otherwise )
-light off! esp Recon Nyx


DONE - BUGFIXES:



TO DO - FEATURES:

-research practical HE airburst implementation (cfg or sqf), then add 82mm, 120mm, 155mm, 227mm

-magazine shell count attributes code? (Who wrote this, what is meant by it?)
-only disable driver = 4, for modularity

-explain target marker referencing to current subscribers


DONE - FEATURES:

-added 230mm laser guided and AT guided rockets (unclear if they work)


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-if vehicle speed = 0 then turn off engine true
-cannot open map with: mortar, MRL, static AA / AT / ATGM, laser des

-if turret azimuth matches target azimuth, turn green
-if charge is correct for target distance, turn green


DONE - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-create turret elevation formula: https://github.com/RemoteControlledArty/RemoteControlledArtillery/wiki/Artillery-Required-Elevation-Calculator-(High&Low-Trajectory)


IDEAS - FUTURE:

-vanilla asset overwrite for gamemodes without zeus etc
-switch driver and commander of radar








OLD (only kept copy as history):

TO DO - BUGFIXES:

-figure out why MRL and sometimes Howitzer shoots left/right if not aligned...


DONE - BUGFIXES:

-remove human crew hpp and hpp include in config
-hasdriver=-1 removed from all vics
-added lockdriver/commander to likely all vics
-all vehicles now steerable again
-target range cut of when 5 digits
-target cycle keybinds (4 is MRS/MLRS charge) change to 3 and 5

-fix RC_ATGM privated
-fix loop when joining server


TO DO - FEATURES:

-HE airburst, 82mm, 120mm, 155mm, 227mm

-magazine shell count attributes code? (Who wrote this, what is meant by it?)
-only disable driver = 4, for modularity

-explain target marker referencing to current subscribers


DONE - FEATURES:

-RCdisableseats= 1 for loacking commander seat  2 for locking driver and commander seat
-isRCarty=1;  as mod friendly check if display should appear
-howitzer can drive in gunner seat
-added target marker referencing, calculation and display

-added 230mm laser guided and AT guided rockets (unclear if they work)

-added 


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-light off! esp Recon Nyx

-if vehicle speed = 0 then turn off engine true
-cannot open map with: mortar, MRL, static AA / AT / ATGM, laser des

-if turret azimuth matches target azimuth, turn green
-if charge is correct for target distance, turn green

-improve turret elevation formula, that accounts for elevation difference better


DONE - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-create basic turret elevation formula https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fsya2kyque?lang=de
