/*
	TO DO / DONE LIST
*/


TO DO - BUGFIXES:

-make MLRS/MRL rockets appear in launcher (if possible)
-RC Recon RADAR activated by default to make it actually usefull (works when deleting commander and activating it manual, or human ai is in there, no with uav ai even with https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/setVehicleRadar)
-RC IC if hull and engine is red then remove AI until repaired, so it doesnt keep getting engaged

-does it still need include check for ace hpp?
-if arty is destroyed, ui stays...?


DONE - BUGFIXES:

-UI fixed on normal UI scale
-lights off, can simply be done by user in the UAV terminal
-Olive Backpack picture background fix
-armor value fixes
-changed to 9.8066 Gravity
-engine turnoff delay exceptions now per cfg value
-if does not camera points in sky (cannot find range), show red warning "raise camera", (accuracy will be way off and submunitions wont deploy otherwise)
-fix radar turrets viewoptics maxhorrotspeed

-fixed distance calculation
-fixed time of flight calculation


TO DO - FEATURES:

documentation:
-update removemagazine list
-add new assets to cfg patches list

arty:
-add datalink & laser firing solution display
-add low trajectory TOP DOWN formula & display for when multiguided is used (low firing solution + 200meter height)
-datalink selected target speed display near firing solution, to decide if it makes sence to fire
-fix arty laser spot tracker/ find way to actually include datalink in designator
-find out why 227mm HEAB has no recoil

-Mortar should keep "false" airburst, as it could explode otherwise, while Howitzer and MLRS/MRL can move and avoid obstructions and can use "true" airburst
-direct fire firing solution (camera viewpoint)

general:
-change uav connection script location
-assault pack for AR-3&4	//would add a bit much backpacks
-decrease sensor angles
-fix Static AT laser engaging

RC IC:
-hide seats for RC IC
-attemt to add commander seat to RC IC


DONE - FEATURES:

-added 82mm, 120mm, 155mm, 227mm HE Airburst
-added 82mm, 120mm, 155mm Laser Guided 1.8m Delayed Fuse (for use against small bunkers/ hangars/ ammo storage halls) but only available per attributes edit for balancing reasons
-improved spead of cluster and mines
-buffed smoke of 82mm, 120mm, 155mm
-added 82mm AP and AT mines
-40 magazines for all shells
-required low&high turret elevation display + ETA
-if turret azimuth matches target azimuth, turn green
-if charge is correct for target distance, turn green
-if azimuth correct, turret elevation correct "ready to fire"
-warning if camera is pointed not at sky
-explain target marker referencing to current subscribers

(new)
-ammunition naming improvements
-added Datalink panel
-added Datalink laser position finder
-added Datalink selected target position finder
-added AR-3 & 4
-added 604mm ATACMS
-added RC Infantry Carrier
-renamed assets for clarity
-155mm dispersion fixed
-more but finer 155mm charges, to have more angle variety, and enough airburst even with low angle solution
-added optional 67km datalink range (max firing range)
-added peak ASL calculation
-shortend map marker search time (as its only running during active remote control, and improves quality of life)
-fixed all sensor configs
-added 82mm/120/155mm/227mm Laser/IR/Vis Guided (Can in manual fire lock laser and vehicles on Datalink panel. Or in artillery computer fire find laser spots, and hot (per IR) or cold (per Visual) vehicles.)
-reworked 82mm/120/155mm/227mm Laser/IR/Vis Guided, to be more accurate and Multi Target
-reworked Static AT & ATGM, changed ammo from 4 HEAT & 2 HE to new 4 MT (MultiTarget) rounds, Static AT now has more locking options and also SACLOS
-reworked 120mm charges
-multi guided successfully tested to include gps guidance, but so far only when using artillery computer
-artillery weapon edits in steps, so different versions can be chosen V1 until V4
-split shown ELDiff, and ElDiff for used calculation, to not cause errors
-enabled NLOS for locking ATGM
-tweaked AT mine spread
-reworked 120mm, 155mm, 227mm Airburst, to truly explode before impact (instead of being reset 20meters after impact)
-decided to not use reworked Airburst for 82mm as it can cause fatal explosion when camera is obstructed and not able to point in sky


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-only disable driver = 4, for modularity
-https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/lockCameraTo  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/enableDirectionStabilization  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/camSetTarget
-azimuth camera lock (marker, laser, selected, off), as uneven surfaces make keeping azimuth aligned problematic
-or atleast hotkey to swing to azimuth *cannot lock directly to direction of target to az changing with uneven ground
-maybe turret elevation lock?

-markers showing up on datalink panel, to be lockable for gps guidance?
-get missle feed panel to connect to missle

-attemt to create O mine pattern
-magazine shell count attributes code? (Who wrote this, what is meant by it?)
-attemt slight forward offset for airburst, so it has better low angle airburst, but not large high angle impact difference
-aiAmmoUsageFlags https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/CfgAmmo_Config_Reference#aiAmmoUsageFlags


DONE - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-lower FOV for driving now available
-option for very slightly shorter map marker search
-if vehicle speed = 0 then turn off engine true

-map now available for ALL assets :D
-significant mod folder and hpp restructure


IDEAS - FAR FUTURE:

-vanilla asset overwrite for gamemodes without zeus etc
-switch driver and commander of recon radar
-3R MRSI display
-3R automated MRSI
-parachute cam round for spotting (or simply additional rhs comp mod for hunt ir)

-turret elevationmode=3 (switchable between manual and automatic), changing script to low trajectory, and point of aim height instead ground height
-IFV with 50mm programmable Airburst, including lower charges for NLOS fire using datalink

-getting misslecam panel to work with multiguided
-counterbattery radar, reporting targets to datalink network, with cba settings on detection speed and range
-RC respawn truck















OLD (only kept copy as history):

TO DO - BUGFIXES:

-figure out why MRL and sometimes Howitzer shoots left/right if not aligned...


DONE - BUGFIXES:

-remove human crew hpp and hpp include in config
-hasdriver=-1 removed from all vics
-added lockdriver/commander to likely all vics
-all vehicles now steerable again
-target range cut of when 5 digits
-target cycle keybinds (4 is MRS/MLRS charge) change to 3 and 5

-fix RC_ATGM privated
-fix loop when joining server


TO DO - FEATURES:

-HE airburst, 82mm, 120mm, 155mm, 227mm

-magazine shell count attributes code? (Who wrote this, what is meant by it?)
-only disable driver = 4, for modularity

-explain target marker referencing to current subscribers


DONE - FEATURES:

-RCdisableseats= 1 for loacking commander seat  2 for locking driver and commander seat
-isRCarty=1;  as mod friendly check if display should appear
-howitzer can drive in gunner seat
-added target marker referencing, calculation and display

-added 230mm laser guided and AT guided rockets (unclear if they work)

-added 


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-light off! esp Recon Nyx

-if vehicle speed = 0 then turn off engine true
-cannot open map with: mortar, MRL, static AA / AT / ATGM, laser des

-if turret azimuth matches target azimuth, turn green
-if charge is correct for target distance, turn green

-improve turret elevation formula, that accounts for elevation difference better


DONE - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-create basic turret elevation formula https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fsya2kyque?lang=de
