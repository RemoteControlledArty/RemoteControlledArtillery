/*
	TO DO / DONE LIST
*/


NOTES TO SELF:
-wood+too few sandbag roof of usual MG/GMG bunkers do luckly not protect against 155mm airburst
-gps marker lock, fire, then remove gps marker is efficient NLOS fire & forget


TO DO - BUGFIXES:

-report bug to ace team: turret is locked unable to adjust up/down, when scope of player is adjustable, despite being in remote control
-report bug to ace team: crl+h cuts connection and destroys UV *only with my hotkeys

-changing arty marker name changes distance (like arty1 to arty1 smoke), same when deleting marker on the map, and replacing it, while moving them doesnt seem to have that effect
-only 1 gps marker active at a time (newest one), moving them deactives it

-artillery gun laying resetting in multiplayer, but not always..?
-find seat locking fix for recon radar, test case 6
-uav laser spot not updating on moving target, for some players, for me it did
*it reverted to a laser that was old by another player before releasing the drone and the other taking over, that was also visible for other player, and didnt dissapear when deleting the uav
-artillery computer was available during op with massive lag, maybe because the op was older it had different settings still?

TO DO - FEATURES:

Arty:
-renaming markers requires cycling once, only one gps marker usable at a time (latest marker is active), moved gps markers deactivate,
-check after upload if createvehiclelocal gps works for multiplayer

-make delayed fuze also ir capable
-check ICV engine off on server


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:


POSTPONED:

-adding missile launcher to FSV 40mm
-disable turning out option of RC IC
-smaller magazine shell count selection in attributes
-guided with simulation shotmissle but with altered values, testing if it connects to misslefeed *it does on manned vic, somehow not on rc'ed... same on Static ATGM
-1.5m Airburst for MP Guided
-fix RC ICV2 smokelauncher
-if RC ICV/IFV hull and engine is red then remove AI until repaired, so it doesnt keep getting engaged (explosion timer shortend for now)
-if possible fix and readd RC ICV datalink panel (removed for now)
-make RC Medical driver camera available for Transporter&Van, after having found a fix
-add RC Repair, needs repair script first, vehicle (thislist select 0) setfuel 1; vehicle (thislist select 0) setdamage 0; https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/createTrigger
-fix Static AT self engaging laser spots (how?)
-RADAR staying on (deactivates after releasing control even when not autonomous, maybe human crew and locked seats instead?)
-guided submunition alternative scripted misslecam
-more RC Infantry Carrier's / APC's / IVF's
-ETA 5sec warning message
-proximityExplosionDistance= ; ammo testing
-seek after unlocked fire for guided (by cfg value in guided mag, script automatically locking target at arty1 pos, and removing target when round is fired, like 1r less in mag or mag changes)


IDEAS - FAR FUTURE:

-sensor ammo, like attaching hidden vehicle with 360deg sensor, deploy xmeter over target, then limited lifetime
-parachute cam round for spotting (or simply additional rhs comp mod for hunt ir, maybe with datalink/laser)
-counterbattery radar, reporting targets to datalink network, with cba settings on detection speed and range

-hotkey to mark selected datalink target on map with time (and maybe speed)
-disconnect uav/ugv from terminal script when vanilla incapacitated / ace unconcious

-AR-0.5 pvp, with 1.5 zoom to force low flying, shortrange sensors, no thermal, but laser designator
-RC Marid with upgraded engines 7.62x51 and smoke GL
-test passive radar shells against active radar AA
-video partially at night for rocket and explosion effects
-make MLRS/MRL rockets appear in launcher (if possible)
-https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/lockCameraTo  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/enableDirectionStabilization  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/camSetTarget
-azimuth camera lock (marker, laser, selected, off), as uneven surfaces make keeping azimuth aligned problematic
-or atleast hotkey to swing to azimuth *cannot lock directly to direction of target to az changing with uneven ground
-vanilla asset overwrite for gamemodes without zeus etc *maybe by second pbo and config, class RC_Howitzer; class vanilla_Howitzer: vanilla_Howitzer  but likely doesnt work
-switch driver and commander of recon radar


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DONE - BUGFIXES:

-UI fixed on normal UI scale
-lights off, can simply be done by user in the UAV terminal
-Olive Backpack picture background fix
-armor value fixes
-changed to 9.807 Gravity
-engine turnoff delay exceptions now per cfg value
-if does not camera points in sky (cannot find range), show red warning "raise camera", (accuracy will be way off and submunitions wont deploy otherwise)
-fix radar turrets viewoptics maxhorrotspeed
-fixed distance calculation
-fixed time of flight calculation
-engine turnoff now per cfg value, so it doesnt affect other ugv's
-found cause for sicnificant over/under-shoot, for low trajectory 0.X MIL are indeed needed, nut dont have to be shown on screen, changed green highlight to +-0.5 instead of 1, this solves it
-many many more
-fixed engine off being too fast for multiplayer
-fixed respawn truck script

DONE - FEATURES:

-added 82mm, 105mm, 120mm, 155mm, 230mm HE Airburst

-added RC ICV
-renamed assets for clarity
-more but finer 105mm/120mm/155mm charges, to have more angle variety
-added optional 67km datalink range (max firing range), default display is 30km
-shortend map marker search time (as its only running during active remote control, and improves quality of life)
-fixed all sensor configs
-added 82mm/105mm/120mm/155mm/230mm MultiGuided (Can in manual fire lock laser and vehicles on Datalink panel. Or in artillery computer fire find laser spots, and vehicles with hot engine.)
-reworked 82mm/105mm/120mm/155mm/230mm MultiGuided, to be more accurate and be Multi Purpose (HEAT + frag sleeve)
-reworked Static AT & ATGM, changed ammo from 4 HEAT & 2 HE to 4 new MP rounds, Static AT now has more locking options and also SACLOS
-artillery weapon edits in steps, so different versions can be chosen V1 until V4

-enabled NLOS targeting for locking ATGM
-tweaked mine spread
-reworked 82mm/105mm/120mm/155mm/230mm Airburst, to truly explode before impact (instead of being reset 20meters after impact)
-minor change to howitzer max gun elevation for it be able to shoot closer during compound defense
-added RC Respawn Vehicles & for the Truck a correct driver camera screen with filter
-reworked Laser Guided 2m Delayed Fuse
-added nightvision to RC RespawnTruck driver camera
-added LaserDatalink so that handheld LaserDesignators enable reliable use with Artillery, and decreases reliance of UAV's with Datalink
-testing showed that locking MultiGuided to laser target, firing manual, deactivating laser, has 3 practical results:
	if nothing else is close it switches to gps guidance,
	or if enemy vehicles are close it locks on them,
	which is extremly usefull if the Forward Observer is suppressed and cannot maintain the lase,
	if the laser is reactivated, it relocks if it is close enough to the original point
-added AR1/AR3 backpacks
-added important muzzle position estimation formula in the script, for improved accuracy
-added ammo usage flags for ai
-fixed sound and effects for new artillery ammunition
-added ground dust effect for airburst
-added FSV with improved FOV
-added Datalink Guided Missles for FSV
-added FSV hpp and subcategory
-individualized ground dust radius and amount of airburst for calibers, and increased dust time
-added 105mm for later use (no suited platform yet found)
-updated remove/addmagazine list, and included as txt
-added missile approach warning systems

-added vehicle mortar, to attach onto vehicles as composition, with edited elevation to allow low trajectory fire shortening TOF
-added more version of respawn vehicles, and reduced threat/cost so it doesnt get engaged
-simplified naming of 120mm magazines
-aligned by +-MIL now show up colored orange/yellow/green, to align quicker and not accidently go past it
-fixed Artillery UI staying when asset is destroyed
-removed Ti from AR-1 as it isnt effected by the ppeffects script
-updated the seat lock script, to be usable for FSV/MBT, to unlock seats again when not in UV control
-added if (!isserver) exitwith {}; to eventhandlers so its not executed multiple times, but server only
-added cfg value _reenableSeats for use in specific vehicles
-FSV/MBT/IC seat locking scripts finally work now, have to be optimized/bugtested still
-given controllable driver of Recon RADAR sensor panel to activate active RADAR with ctrl+R (as the RADAR Vehicle doesnt fully work atm)
-made grenade dropping UAV "shortranged"
-enabled camera lock on target for static laser designator
-for now locked FSV/MBT driver seat, as it had a buggy view when remote controlling, will attemt to fix later
-equalized FSV/MBT gunnercoax/commander MG to .338 NM
-guided round rename to be more neutral
-fixed zero devider error in firing solution calculator by preventing _targetDistance to be <=0

-found out that without ace Mortars dont shoot correctly without vanilla artillery computer, added script that when its disabled and ace is not installed, its still available for mortars
-added disableable warning that activates when ace is installed which informs that ace adjustable scopes block elevation with overlapping hotkeys

-MAJOR breakthrough: added datalink target firing solution, sideeffect is that it shows firing solution for line of sight if looking at an object
-added laserLock/irLock to HE/HEAB, so it can select laser and vehicles on datalink for a firing solution *does not make it guided (not suited to other rounds with distancetotarget=x, except for guided)
-instead of seperate display, added RC_AimAboveHeight close to triggerdistance for guided, to have toptown effect even on high charge for shorter TOF, to not get stuck in foliage/cover/hills
-finally found correct values to make guided shells accurate at high charge instead of completly overshoot
-added script that changes Airburst to Impact when turret elevation is too low for Airburst to work savely
-finally added working gps targeting
-included aimaboveheight into shownELdifference, so with ace tables airburst is accurate, and guided includes topdown
-fixed HEAB by slightly decreasing simulationStep, to not overshoot at low trajectory, or hit ground at high trajectory
-added (cfgmag value) guided round lock requirement for guidance warning when no target is selected, also (cfgmag value) submunition warning when looking at terrain
-for vehicle attached mortar/ or close object blocking viewpoint, when target<=20m (like vehicle its attached to): shows map marker targets instead, shows requires lock message for guided shells
-improved GPS Markers to not be noticed/attacked by AI
-MP Guided now also compatible with gps guidance using vanilla artillery computer


-low/high trajectory list:
	low: HE, HEAB, Guided (Guided has integrated topdown)
	high: Cluster, Smoke, AT/AP Mines, Illum


DONE - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-lower FOV of many Vehicles for better driving now available
-shortend default map marker search time
-if vehicle speed = 0 then engine is turned off, your ears will thank
-map now available for all assets!
-significant mod folder and hpp restructure
