/*
	TO DO / DONE LIST
*/


NOTES TO SELF:
-wood+too few sandbag roof of usual MG/GMG bunkers do luckly not protect against 155mm airburst
-gps marker lock, fire, then remove gps marker is efficient NLOS fire & forget


TO DO - BUGFIXES:

-report bug to ace team: turret is locked unable to adjust up/down, when scope of player is adjustable, despite being in remote control
-report bug to ace team: crl+h cuts connection and destroys UV *only with my hotkeys

-gps target gone after ~3minutes

-gun laying resetting despite autonomous being off (maybe not global?)

-artillery gun laying resetting in multiplayer, but not always..?
-uav laser spot not updating on moving target, for some players, for me it did
*it reverted to a laser that was old by another player before releasing the drone and the other taking over, that was also visible for other player, and didnt dissapear when deleting the uav
-artillery computer was available during op with massive lag, maybe because the op was older it had different settings still?

-medical truck respawn script not working in multiplayer (cfgVehicles, RespawnTruck.hpp)

-Remove ICV II "turn out", as the commander seat is in the removed turret, the turnout is bugged, unclear how to remove turnout eighter by cfg/script
-attemt to (unclear if possible) giving working waypoints to ICV/IFV even when sitting in vehicle (those waypoints bug, and have different extra markings)

-artillery computer is supposedly disabled for all assets, not just of the mod


-CHANGE UAV CHECK, cfg checks/create effect AFTER connected check, in both scripts.
-maybe include blur in main loop to reduce checks

-fix kamysh turnout


TO DO - FEATURES:

ASAP:
-add turret to Marid
-when someone took controls per terminal of icv gunner, it seems to lock the commander seat for people within? can be accessed from outside
-test special marid, O_APC_Wheeled_02_rcws_F, not O_APC_Wheeled_02_rcws_v2_F
-driverless "take controls" check
-check if "release controls" triggers script and assigns someone else
-test g/c "take controls" in mp
-"release controls to overwrite drive controls", "overwritten driver controls", vehicle player vehicleChat "vehicleChat";
	*what if statement to check if EH client is in vehicle? to not trigger message multiple times

-maybe place setgroupowner for UGV gunner in uavblur loop, or testengineon EH
-fix for someone remotecontrolling gunner player, bugging them
-video about vics


generally:
-AR-1 script include for night use: https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/disableTIEquipment
-maybe place setgroupowner for UGV gunner in uavblur loop, or testengineon EH
-hullexplosiondelay doesnt work for Namer?
-update list & readme
-engineoff script doesnt need to be in init if person is connected to uav, with soon arma update it also wouldnt block taking controls for gaining locality, for example when the other is uncon
-doublecheck "min/max" range exact function on sensors

-set ejectdeadcrew to true?

-*notetoself: emty uav/ugv, can be hacked, which spawns gunner, which then can bug my "go to commander"
	partially manned like howitzer dont have that problem, but autonomous driving command to firing position is unavailable
	= RC having driver and gaining locality by driver controls, while giving manned vehilces hasDriver-1; as on those movement order breaks anyways while in the vic

-test cargoIsCoDriver[]={0,0};
	cargoCanControlUAV=0;
	Added: A new DriverOpticsIn parameter for vehicle drivers (similar to turret OpticsIn, but it uses OpticsModel instead gunnerOpticsModel for the optics model)

-stabilization impacts aiming?
-IFV II 30mm + ATGM
-fix driverview on IFV/FSV/MBT & Trucks
-soon with arma update connectionfix wont be needed anymore


Arty:
-minimum datalink distance 50m instead of 20m / or "object" recognition & display

-test FCS without ace on uneven ground
-adding FCS, and Airburst rounds, to a mods 60mm quick deployable Mortar

-Counter Artillery Radar -> brainstorm on options: map markers for shot locations / share source vehicle in datalink but delayed for balancing, and how its even technically possible for different mods
-comment for round like "smoke", for example below T: 01 UI, for better coordination and less required radio chatter
-peak ASL formula and display infront of ETA, optimal but a bit much UI would be also be ASL at 25% of distance, to estimate if rounds will collide with hills close to gun/target

-autonomous off JIP global execute?

-make delayed fuze also ir capable for gps targets  *might require sicnificant change of the round as people might use it against vehicles, but its currently not HEAT


FSV/IFV:
-invert locality script for ICV's
-smoke ammo, 40mm bulletbase change to shotshellbase with smoke submunition
-more RC ICV's / APC's / IVF's / MBT's
-check ICV engine off on server *needs remoteexecute?
-additional x2 SACLOS only missles, vorona or edited titan
-automatic switch to left missilecamera when missile is launched


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:


POSTPONED:

-adding missile launcher to FSV 40mm
-disable turning out option of RC IC
-smaller magazine shell count selection in attributes
-guided with simulation shotmissle but with altered values, testing if it connects to misslefeed *it does on manned vic, somehow not on rc'ed... same on Static ATGM
-1.5m Airburst for MP Guided
-fix RC ICV2 smokelauncher
-if RC ICV/IFV hull and engine is red then remove AI until repaired, so it doesnt keep getting engaged (explosion timer shortend for now)
-if possible fix and readd RC ICV datalink panel (removed for now)
-make RC Medical driver camera available for Transporter&Van, after having found a fix
-add RC Repair, needs repair script first, vehicle (thislist select 0) setfuel 1; vehicle (thislist select 0) setdamage 0; https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/createTrigger
-fix Static AT self engaging laser spots (how?)
-RADAR staying on (deactivates after releasing control even when not autonomous, maybe human crew and locked seats instead?)
-guided submunition alternative scripted misslecam
-ETA 5sec warning message
-proximityExplosionDistance= ; ammo testing
-seek after unlocked fire for guided (by cfg value in guided mag, script automatically locking target at arty1 pos, and removing target when round is fired, like 1r less in mag or mag changes)


IDEAS - FAR FUTURE:

-sensor ammo, like attaching hidden vehicle with 360deg sensor, deploy xmeter over target, then limited lifetime
-parachute cam round for spotting (or simply additional rhs comp mod for hunt ir, maybe with datalink/laser)
-counterbattery radar, reporting targets to datalink network, with cba settings on detection speed and range

-hotkey to mark selected datalink target on map with time (and maybe speed)
-disconnect uav/ugv from terminal script when vanilla incapacitated / ace unconcious

-AR-0.5 pvp, with 1.5 zoom to force low flying, shortrange sensors, no thermal, but laser designator
-RC Marid with upgraded engines 7.62x51 and smoke GL
-test passive radar shells against active radar AA
-video partially at night for rocket and explosion effects
-make MLRS/MRL rockets appear in launcher (if possible)
-https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/lockCameraTo  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/enableDirectionStabilization  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/camSetTarget
-azimuth camera lock (marker, laser, selected, off), as uneven surfaces make keeping azimuth aligned problematic
-or atleast hotkey to swing to azimuth *cannot lock directly to direction of target to az changing with uneven ground
-vanilla asset overwrite for gamemodes without zeus etc *maybe by second pbo and config, class RC_Howitzer; class vanilla_Howitzer: vanilla_Howitzer  but likely doesnt work
-switch driver and commander of recon radar
-for later use, no crosshair limited FOV: gunnerOpticsModel="A3\drones_f\Weapons_F_Gamma\Reticle\UGV_01_Optics_Driver_F.p3d";

-fixed distance calculation
-fixed time of flight calculation
-engine turnoff now per cfg value, so it doesnt affect other ugv's
-found cause for sicnificant over/under-shoot, for low trajectory 0.X MIL are indeed needed, nut dont have to be shown on screen, changed green highlight to +-0.5 instead of 1, this solves it
-many many more

-added RC Respawn Vehicles & for the Truck a correct driver camera screen with filter
-reworked Laser Guided 2m Delayed Fuse
-added nightvision to RC RespawnTruck driver camera
-added LaserDatalink so that handheld LaserDesignators enable reliable use with Artillery, and decreases reliance of UAV's with Datalink
-testing showed that locking MultiGuided to laser target, firing manual, deactivating laser, has 3 practical results:
	if nothing else is close it switches to gps guidance,
	or if enemy vehicles are close it locks on them,
	which is extremly usefull if the Forward Observer is suppressed and cannot maintain the lase,
	if the laser is reactivated, it relocks if it is close enough to the original point

-updated the seat lock script, to be usable for FSV/MBT, to unlock seats again when not in UV control
-added if (!isserver) exitwith {}; to eventhandlers so its not executed multiple times, but server only
-added cfg value _reenableSeats for use in specific vehicles
-FSV/MBT/IC seat locking scripts finally work now, have to be optimized/bugtested still
-given controllable driver of Recon RADAR sensor panel to activate active RADAR with ctrl+R (as the RADAR Vehicle doesnt fully work atm)
-made grenade dropping UAV "shortranged"
-enabled camera lock on target for static laser designator

-added disableable warning that activates when ace is installed which informs that ace adjustable scopes block elevation with overlapping hotkeys
-MAJOR breakthrough: added datalink target firing solution, sideeffect is that it shows firing solution for line of sight if looking at an object
-added laserLock/irLock to HE/HEAB, so it can select laser and vehicles on datalink for a firing solution *does not make it guided (not suited to other rounds with distancetotarget=x, except for guided)
-instead of seperate display, added RC_AimAboveHeight close to triggerdistance for guided, to have toptown effect even on high charge for shorter TOF, to not get stuck in foliage/cover/hills
-finally found correct values to make guided shells accurate at high charge instead of completly overshoot
-added script that changes Airburst to Impact when turret elevation is too low for Airburst to work savely

-improved GPS Markers to not be noticed/attacked by AI
-MP Guided now also compatible with gps guidance using vanilla artillery computer
-now greys out the firing solution & ETA for unsuited low or high trajectory depending on shell

new:
