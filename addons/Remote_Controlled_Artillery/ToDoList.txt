/*
	TO DO / DONE LIST
*/


TO DO - BUGFIXES:

major:
-arty marker distance becomes distance to likely 0,0,0 when renaming (fixed by manually pressing cycle markers, not caused by moving marker)
-gun laying resetting despite autonomous being off (maybe not global/JIP?)
-artillery computer is supposedly disabled for all assets after this mods artillery is used once, not just of the mod  *add option to keep it enabled on high angle only mortars
-223mm self seeking inaccurate/not working if first target is lost

minor:
-gps target gone after ~3minutes
-medical truck respawn script not working in multiplayer (cfgVehicles, RespawnTruck.hpp)

notes:
-report bug to ace team: turret is locked unable to adjust up/down, when scope of player is adjustable, despite being in remote control
-report bug to ace team: crl+h cuts connection and destroys UV *only with my hotkeys
-report bug to ace team: one of the left/right vehicle panels closes when opening map
-find solution for ace r reload
-soon with arma update connectionfix likely wont be needed anymore


TO DO - FEATURES:

-remove RE autonomous off? might cause problems and in MP doesnt fullfill its function, instead add in tipps section below FCS that autonomous off = turret not resetting

-EH getout if no player in => engineoff
-AFV commander take over controls script
-nerfed IFV subcategory (all 20mm)

-"almost aligned message" and +-1 accuracy clearer color difference (for smokes etc)

-double check autonomous remote execute structure with Eric (JIP global execute?)
-attemt to make locality fix per custom server cba EH

-idea: CounterBatteryRadar that has init EH that spawns check for artillery assets of opposing sides (how to do this performance effective), and attaches EH fired to them?
-2 variants, player (notification, rough mark, maybe Datalink target) and AI (automatic return fire),  with cba settings

-find solution for guided round that starts seeking without needing initial target lock (maybe with "aimAboveTarget" value or "lockSeekDistanceFromParent"?)

-post CB scripts, and add sound
-medical patria/otokar/pandur
-FIX MORTAR ACCURACY on uneven ground (AZ not changing with EL)
-when someone "took controls" per terminal of icv gunner, it seems to lock the commander seat for people within? can be accessed from outside *needs testing
-add sensor to mortar carrier camera


checks/testing:

-maybe place setgroupowner for UGV gunner in uavblur loop, or testengineon EH
-doublecheck mortar laser guided accuary in MP
-doublecheck "min/max" range exact function on sensors
-set ejectdeadcrew to true?
-test: cargoIsCoDriver[]={0,0}; cargoCanControlUAV=0;
-fix driverview on medical Trucks  BI:"Added: A new DriverOpticsIn parameter for vehicle drivers (similar to turret OpticsIn, but it uses OpticsModel instead gunnerOpticsModel for the optics model)"

Arty:
-comment for round like "smoke", for example below T: 01 UI, for better coordination and less required radio chatter
-fix autoseektarget friend/foe problem...
-test out SubmunitionTargetDirection for guided, with triggerDistance=; and proximityExplosionDistance=;
-test FCS without ace on uneven ground
-adding FCS, and Airburst rounds, to a mods 60mm quick deployable Mortar

AFV:
-variant of Patria AMV with 30mm + ATGM
-smoke ammo, 40mm bulletbase change to shotshellbase with smoke submunition
-automatic switch to left missilecamera when missile is launched


TO DO - QUALITY OF LIFE:

-hotkey to mark selected datalink target on map with time (and maybe speed)


POSTPONED:

-peak ASL formula and display infront of ETA, optimal but a bit much UI would be also be ASL at 25% of distance, to estimate if rounds will collide with hills close to gun/target
-make delayed fuze also ir capable for gps targets  *might require sicnificant change of the round as people might use it against vehicles, but its currently not HEAT
-renable semi-UGV terminal use by preventing taking control over gunner if gunner is player
-video about vics & fpv
-remove -RC Patria AMV unarmed "turn out", as the commander seat is in the removed turret, the turnout is bugged, unclear how to remove turnout eighter by cfg/script
-attemt to (unclear if possible) giving working waypoints to ICV/IFV even when sitting in vehicle (those waypoints bug, and have different extra markings)
-smaller magazine shell count selection in attributes
-guided with simulation shotmissle but with altered values, testing if it connects to misslefeed *it does on manned vic, somehow not on rc'ed... same on Static ATGM
-1.5m Airburst for MP Guided
-fix RC ICV2 smokelauncher
-if RC ICV/IFV hull and engine is red then remove AI until repaired, so it doesnt keep getting engaged (explosion timer shortend for now)
-if possible fix and readd RC ICV datalink panel (removed for now)
-make RC Medical driver camera available for Transporter&Van, after having found a fix
-add RC Repair, needs repair script first, vehicle (thislist select 0) setfuel 1; vehicle (thislist select 0) setdamage 0; https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/createTrigger
-fix Static AT self engaging laser spots (how?)
-RADAR staying on (deactivates after releasing control even when not autonomous, maybe human crew and locked seats instead?)
-guided submunition alternative scripted misslecam
-ETA 5sec warning message
-proximityExplosionDistance= ; ammo testing
-seek after unlocked fire for guided (by cfg value in guided mag, script automatically locking target at arty1 pos, and removing target when round is fired, like 1r less in mag or mag changes)


IDEAS - FAR FUTURE:

-sensor ammo, like attaching hidden vehicle with 360deg sensor, deploy xmeter over target, then limited lifetime
-parachute cam round for spotting (or simply additional rhs comp mod for hunt ir, maybe with datalink/laser)

-disconnect uav/ugv from terminal script when vanilla incapacitated / ace unconcious

-AR-0.5 pvp, with 1.5 zoom to force low flying, shortrange sensors, no thermal, but laser designator
-test passive radar shells against active radar AA
-video partially at night for rocket and explosion effects
-https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/lockCameraTo  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/enableDirectionStabilization  /  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/camSetTarget
-azimuth camera lock (marker, laser, selected, off), as uneven surfaces make keeping azimuth aligned problematic
-or atleast hotkey to swing to azimuth *cannot lock directly to direction of target to az changing with uneven ground
-vanilla asset overwrite for gamemodes without zeus etc *maybe by second pbo and config, class RC_Howitzer; class vanilla_Howitzer: vanilla_Howitzer  but likely doesnt work

-added RC Respawn Vehicles & for the Truck a correct driver camera screen with filter
-reworked Laser Guided 2m Delayed Fuse
-added nightvision to RC RespawnTruck driver camera
-added LaserDatalink so that handheld LaserDesignators enable reliable use with Artillery, and decreases reliance of UAV's with Datalink
-testing showed that locking MultiGuided to laser target, firing manual, deactivating laser, has 3 practical results:
	if nothing else is close it switches to gps guidance,
	or if enemy vehicles are close it locks on them,
	which is extremly usefull if the Forward Observer is suppressed and cannot maintain the lase,
	if the laser is reactivated, it relocks if it is close enough to the original point

-added disableable warning that activates when ace is installed which informs that ace adjustable scopes block elevation with overlapping hotkeys
-MAJOR breakthrough: added datalink target firing solution, sideeffect is that it shows firing solution for line of sight if looking at an object
-added laserLock/irLock to HE/HEAB, so it can select laser and vehicles on datalink for a firing solution *does not make it guided (not suited to other rounds with distancetotarget=x, except for guided)
-instead of seperate display, added RC_AimAboveHeight close to triggerdistance for guided, to have toptown effect even on high charge for shorter TOF, to not get stuck in foliage/cover/hills
-finally found correct values to make guided shells accurate at high charge instead of completly overshoot

-added 60mm Ammo/Magazines/Weapon config, for potentially a light Mortar

new:
-added orange "not aligned" message with +-0.75 accuracy for quickly shooting multiple smokes
-changed AR-1 shortrange range to 2km as 1.5km was slightly too short
-smokes now low trajectory compatible, and low firing solution no longer greyed out, they may land slightly worse but it makes them available way quicker and versatile
-reworked artillery charges, from 0-7 to 0-6 charges with min 350MIL low solutions (lower is can get caught, too high is inefficient) for easier cycling
-reworked 120mm & 155mm cannons to have more realistic 40km range (most maps arent larger than 30km anyways), vanilla range is unrealistic 67km
-RC artillery assets now work with fire script commands, as the charges been reworked to be compatible for ai fire
-reworked FPV to be more controllable
-slightly reworked vehicle item loadouts
-improved file structure with includes, like vehicle magazine loadouts of different tracer color
