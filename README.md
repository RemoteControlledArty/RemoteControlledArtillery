# Remote Controlled Artillery Repository

Solving most ARMA Units biggest problem!
Artillery support without:

1. It draining too much personnel from the frontline.
2. Them being bored for 2 hours, crying for firemissions.

Easily balanced by Zeus/Mission Editor being able to precicely set ammunition amount and types.

This mod has a LOT of content despite its very small file size!

Major UPDATE out:
- now ACE compatible! :D (but does not require it)
- now displays charge, azimuth, elevation
- artillery computer can be disabled in options

Content List, ALL of them REMOTE controlled:
connect per UAV Terminal (found in the gps slot)

- Mortars (smoke, HE, laser guided, AT guided, flares)
- Self Propelled Howitzers (smoke, HE, laser guided, AT guided, AT mines, AP mines, cluster)
- Self Propelled 230mm MLRS Systems (HE, cluster)

*smoke can be used for assaulting positions, AT mines can cut off enemy reinforcement roads!

- Static ATGM, carryable by backpack (2km SACLOS wire guided, HEAT and HE), like the Stugna used in the Ukraine War
- Recon Wiesel (Nyx) ATGM (4.5km SACLOS wire guided)
- Static Anti-Air (3.5km), carryable by backpack
- self propelled heavy Anti-Air
- Recon Wiesel (Nyx) Anti-Air
- improved Static Laser Designators (wide FOV, white hot Ti)

Bonus Content:
- New Improved hand held Laser Designators, with wider field of view and white hot Ti instead of eye hurting green hot with optional non Ti versions available. 
- Script to fix UAV's not being able to be connected to if the player previously accessing them Died.
- Extra Remote Controlled Artillery variants that are compatible with Artillery ammunition mods (they are called "non adjustable" in the editor, as the shown code below cannot be used to set the exact amount, thats a custom feature of my mod).

### Highly recommended mod in combination:

[Simple Grid Designators](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2538444208), 
Allows you to set map markers of your current laser designated point, with an 6 or 8 digit grit and elevation, which allows for better coordination when people call in fire support.

[Simple Map Tools](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2013446344),
If you want to play with disabled artillery computer, this mod is very usefull to get the numbers between gun and target.

### From the Authors

#### Ascent
Have fun with the mod and make sure to send me footage of your unit using it! :D
Took me a lot of effort to make this mod (6000 lines of code and LOTS of testing), so please respect that work.

#### Fluffy
I really hope you enjoy all the Tweaks to the UI nice and to fix the Driver Seat and Commander Seat nonsense.
