(Its signed and multiplayer ready)

Solving most ARMA Units biggest problem!
Artillery support without:

1. It draining too much personnel from the frontline...
2. Them being bored for 2 hours, crying for firemissions...

Easily balanced by Zeus/Mission Editor being able to precicely set ammunition amount and types.

This mod has a LOT of content despite its very small file size!

New Artillery Features:
- cycle through "target reference markers" named "arty1" until "arty99" on the map, it will calculate and display target distance, azimuth, and elevation difference
- Fire Control System with low&high trajectory firing solution calculator
*low trajectory sicnificantly shortens time of flight, and increases accuracy!
- datalink panel and integration, with live updating low/high firing solutions for selected target (the real MAGIC, was a TON of work)

- Airburst ammunition, highly effective against trenches etc, for Mortars/Howitzers/MLRS
- MP Guided ammunition, that now works even in manual fire on laser/vehicle/gps targets, *including an optional 2m delayed fuze variant

- lockable gps target by placing a map marker "gps" (only one possible at a time until next updates)
- datalink laser designators, to share laser spot location (for firing solution) with indirect fire assets without them needing line of sight
- finer artillery charges to optimize angle more, like firing over hills with low trajectory

- new RC Mortar Carrier
- improvements to Cluster ammunition


New quality of live features:
- improved vehicle FOV for situational awareness and usability
- automatic vehicle engine turnoff when stopping to improve communication and awareness
- map being available in more vehicles

New assets:
- lowtech&hightech UAV:
- AR-1 has short range, to make it easier for Zeus to build missions, and no thermals (wouldnt work with range limitation script)
- AR-3 has long range, has image recognition & displays targets
- short ranged Grenade Dropping UAV's for all factions (will be improved in next updates)

- remote controllable Infantery Carriers (ICV), to fix most units extrem mobility issues, of having to leave vehicles behind for assault, taking ages to recover, or if not left behind getting destroyed
- automated driver for IFV/FSV/MBT, to remove the job noone wants to do, and decrease dependancy of buggy human ai drivers, also allows to be in the same ace group, improving coordination
- datalink integration and datalink guided NLOS ATGM's for IFV/FSV/MBT

- optional RC Medical Truck's that act as respawn, like for when you dont have air reinsert *feature be enabled with next update


Bonus Content:
- new improved hand held Laser Designators, with wider field of view, and white hot Ti instead of eye hurting green hot (non Ti versions also included)

- script that finally FIXES the common problem of noone being able to connect to a UAV/UGV a player accessed before his death (this fix is a way bigger deal than you might realize)


Current Quirks:
- renaming/moving "arty" markers bugs their distance, fix: cycle markers once, distance corrects (working on fix)
- only one "gps" marker usable at a time (latest marker is active), and moved gps markers deactivate (working on fix)

Quirks using Vanilla Artillery Computer:
- change ammo types per mousewheel menu, not in the artillery computer
- generating the ace rangetable requires having been close to it once
- disabling artillery computer in options after having already used it, requires mission restart (not a big deal, decide beforehand)

Recent bug fixes:
- distance is now correctly calculated
- tons of other stuff


Highly recommended mod in combination:
Simple Grid Designators (link):
Allows you to set map markers of your current laser designated point, with an 6 or 8 digit grit and elevation, which allows for better coordination when people call in fire support.

JSRS (link):
Greatly improves artillery sounds etc.

What is allowed is inheriting and then editing, so that it requires my mod, but tweaks it or introduces additions.

Thanks to:
Fluffy who put an enormous amount of work into this with me.
Aaren for providing the explosion effect.
And my great friend Eric to often help me with scripting problems.

#### Fluffy
I really hope you enjoy all the Tweaks to the UI nice and to fix the Driver Seat and Commander Seat nonsense.
